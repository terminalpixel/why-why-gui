# Why Why GUI?

*Who really needs a GUI anyway?*



## Disclaimer

Note:
- GUI's are not inherently bad, just misused


### Pareto principle

<!-- .slide: data-background="pareto" -->

Note:
- 80 - 20 rule
- 80% of you will spend 80% time on a computer coding, browsing & in the terminal


<h3 class="personal-slant"> A Personal Slant</h3>

Note:
- This is from my personal perspective as mainly a web developer
- But hopefully will apply to most people



## What is a GUI?


### Graphical User Interface

Note:
- Covers many things from websites to card machines to phones to dwms



## Factors

Note:
- What is important


### Contextual

Note:
- In a perfect world everything gets out of the way
- What you need is there when you need it


### Productivity

Note:
- In general you are trying to get shit done


### Annoyance

Note:
- Ease of use
- Your GUI should not piss you off


### Immersion

Note:
- In certain scenarios GUIs can distract from what is truly going on
- Example show the exact same game but the immersion levels differ

## Desktop window managers

Note:
- So many useless features


### Enough with the floating windows already

<img class="roll-in" src="img/windows-window-border.jpg" alt="Windows window border"></img>
<img class="fragment roll-in" src="img/mac-window-border.jpg" alt="OSX window border"></img>
<img class="fragment roll-in" src="img/ubuntu-window-border.jpg" alt="Ubuntu window border"></img>

Note:
- What's the point?
- They just get in the way
- Window borders are useless. They take up valuable screen real estate for 3 functions.
- And resizing windows is totally inefficient
- It's not just windows...


### Everyone's worst nightmare

<span class="fragment fade-in god-damn-pop-ups--1">God</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in god-damn-pop-ups--2">Damn</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in god-damn-pop-ups--3">Pop</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in god-damn-pop-ups--4">Ups</span>

Note:
- Floating window managers are the worst for these!


### <span class="so-spacious">Space</span>

<div class="screen-size-example">
    <img style="width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 100%; max-width: 100%; margin: 0; padding: 0;" src="img/mac-vertical-space.png" alt="Windows window border"></img>
    <div class="fragment fade-in screen-size-example__cover--menubar"><span class="screen-size-example__percentage">2.6%</span></div>
    <div class="fragment fade-in screen-size-example__cover--chrome"><span class="screen-size-example__percentage">8.6%</span></div>
    <div class="fragment fade-in screen-size-example__cover--bookmarks"><span class="screen-size-example__percentage">3.5%</span></div>
    <div class="fragment fade-in screen-size-example__cover--dock"><span class="screen-size-example__percentage">10.7%</span></div>
    <div class="fragment fade-in screen-size-example__remainder"><span class="screen-size-example__percentage">75.3%</span></div>
</div>

Note:
- DWMs take up a lot of space
- This is an actual example of a client.


### <span class="so-fast">Speed</span>

Note:
- Clicking around is simply slower


### <span class="so-heavy">Weight</span>

Note:
- They are bigger and more complex than other alternatives


### <span class="invert-text" >Touch Screen Devices</span>

<!-- .slide: data-background="img/ios-android-windows.jpg" -->

Note:
- This was a chance to ditch traditional GUIs
- They ditched floating windows for a reason
- Things hidden away until needed



## The alternatives


### Half way houses
#### *Get out of the way a little more*
<h4 class="fragment">Windows 8</h4>
<h4 class="fragment">Gnome 3</h4>

Note:
- I know they still have windows but you can see the movement away from the ancient principals


### The full english
#### *Tiling window managers*
<h4 class="fragment">Keyboard driven</h4>
<h4 class="fragment">Highly configurable</h4>
<h4 class="fragment">Suitable for any hardware</h4>

Note:
- Any time away from the keyboard wastes time
- My window manger is completely customisable with a few hundred lines of code
- Super fast


### Not quite there yet
#### *What to expect in the future*
<h4 class="fragment">More contextual interfaces</h4>
<h4 class="fragment">Smarter voice control</h4>
<h4 class="fragment">Gestures everywhere</h4>
<h4 class="fragment">Brain control</h4>

Note:
- Some of this has already begun
- Info on what restaurants are nearby if it is an appropriate time
- Google will already give you your flight and hotel details when you are travelling on a holiday
- Voice control is fairly useful but can't yet perform complex tasks such as programming
- Gestures on touchsceens and 3d sensors are cool and get GUI out of the way but they need to be more standardised and don't offer much benefit over a keyboard for the majority of common tasks
- I think brain control is the final step. It's the only thing I can see being more efficient than any of the other options in every scenario.
- But that is a long way away, so what can you do now?



## Tips & tricks


### Learn your shortcuts

<h4 class="fragment">vim all the things</h4>

Note:
- Pretty much every thing has vim shortcuts
- cVim for chrome, Pentadactyl for firefox
- Most tiling window managers
- Even gmail shortcuts are based on vim


### Get a decent shell

<h4 class="fragment">zsh / fish</h4>

Note:
- They just make life easier with smart autocompletion and helpful extras
- Recommend oh-my-zsh and oh-my-fish for some nice defaults


### Automate

<h4 class="fragment">JavaScript task runners are pretty cool</h4>
<h4 class="fragment">Shell scripting is easier than you would think</h4>

Note:
- Task runners let you automate menial development tasks like concatenation or image optimisation


### Spend the time to customize

Note:
- All these thing require a decent bit of work
- But having everything exactly as you need it is worth it
